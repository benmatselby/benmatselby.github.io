    Since the start of the year, I&rsquo;ve been running weekly workshops with Paddy Morgan at work. These have been fun sessions to run. Some have been chats, some demos etc.
However, this week we ran a &ldquo;Git 101&rdquo; workshop. Weirdly, this was the most attended workshop we have run, with around 50 engineers joining throughout the hour session.
This post covers what we ran through.

    This year has seen a transformation in terms of working practices. Whether things will ever go back to the way they were, I do not know, but there is one thing I hope will remain.
To sum up the last 3 years. I went from managing a team of engineers located in 2 geographic locations, to becoming a remote Individual Contributor in a co-located team. This year changed everything, and we all became engineers in a distributed team.

The tools this post is going to compare are:
 AWS CodePipeline (As I happen to be working in the AWS space at the moment) Jenkins GitHub Actions  A couple of things to note:
 This post almost exclusively talks about AWS CodePipeline, but you will almost certainly require AWS CodeBuild too.

    Finding out when code changes in your project is easy. Whether it is version control, build notifications, GitHub/GitLab notifications, there are many delivery mechanisms to notify you.
But what about all that documentation you spend a lot of time on. Curating your system, tweaking guidelines, and examples. How do you get teams of engineers to know about changes?
There isn&rsquo;t that many options in this space.
If you are a Slack user, and if you use GitHub as your documentation/wiki space, then the Gollum Page Watcher can help.

    When forming a new team (or joining a team for that matter), I always try to get the following item in our code review standards, or ways of working.
Make sure all commits in version control are logically atomic.  What is a logically atomic commit A logically atomic commit is the smallest, most meaningful change you can make to the software. It&rsquo;s big enough to add value, but small enough to be manageable.

This means it now fully conforms to the metadata specification as defined here.
I wrote this action back when GitHub Actions were still in beta, and there were very few actions out there. It turns out there are a plethora of GitHub Actions to now deploy a Hugo site to GitHub Pages, but where is the fun in using someone else&rsquo;s?

    This post aims to cover off a simple checklist üìù to work through when joining a new engineering team üë©üèæ‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª. Whilst this is aimed at senior or technical lead positions, these tips can help everyone.
I&rsquo;ve recently switched teams at work, and something dawned on me. Over the last 8 or so years I&rsquo;ve generally built teams, and not really joined an existing team. So joining an existing team, with their own established ways of working, and existing decisions is something rather üëΩ to me.

    This post aims to cover off how to drive quality in your software products, by defining and using a &ldquo;Design Authority&rdquo;. It tries to call out what the problem is, and how you can use a self assessment to set the standard within your organisation, as to what is acceptable levels of quality within your product.
There are many ways to assess software quality, be it using automation tools, top down assessments from a governance board, or peer reviewed assessments.

    My aim with this blog is to document how I like to run my teams, and note the various things I&rsquo;ve seen during my career. When meeting new people, there is a tendency to cover old ground (I&rsquo;m skilled at this), which is useful in the sense you have a common understanding, but it can be time consuming. A few times recently I&rsquo;ve wanted to provide substantial opinions, but the communication format doesn&rsquo;t lend itself well to that style.

    This post aims to outline a useful structure for software engineering teams. This feels like a fairly standard structure, or at least with the teams I‚Äôve had exposure to. The main principles here are: to keep communication flowing; accountability is defined and understood; and the ability to scale horizontally when your teams become saturated (and for this to be easily quantified).
For the purpose of this article, a team is going to be a product based software engineering team.

    After talking about communication recently, it felt natural to follow up with a post about Teams.
The beginning I love teams. I love my teams. I love building teams. I love working in teams. I love to see what a team can deliver, and grow, and evolve, and have each others back. I would describe myself as a team player, first and foremost. I don&rsquo;t like to be isolated. I like to have a home to anchor me.

    Pipelines.
They are very important in software development, in my opinion. If you do not get your pipeline right, you likely have problems within your team(s).
So, what is a pipeline?
Well, think of it has a conveyor belt in a factory. The software development pipeline is a conveyor belt. From projects, to requirements, to building/testing, to deploying, and to everything in between. Those processes/items are moving along the conveyor, ideally in a smooth fashion.

    I recently got involved in a project where I contributed a patch to an inflight feature branch. I then raised a Pull Request into the feature branch, so I could annotate the code in the GitHub PR to explain why I had done it a certain way. After a bit of back and forth the PR was merged into the feature branch.
Later, I found that the feature branch I had worked on had been merged into master, but the entire branch was squashed down into one commit.

 We have all heard it, and secretly, we have all probably said it too. Setting up your development environment really is a thing. About 10 years ago, I remember spending about two weeks getting a full ISP platform up and running on my host machine. There were a lot of moving parts I didn‚Äôt understand in my first week. I was fairly junior at the time, and this was the first time I was doing development, to this level, on a Linux platform.

    It‚Äôs cliched to say, but communication really is key, and yet it‚Äôs one of the common issues folks seem to raise in departmental or company feedback. ‚ÄúCommunication isn‚Äôt great‚Äù. However, this is both a top down, and a bottom up issue in my opinion (and everything in between).
Top down like to send out update emails, but the flow of communication is one way. Do I reply, reply all, face to face?
