      <description>Since the start of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running weekly workshops with Paddy Morgan at work. These have been fun sessions to run. Some have been chats, some demos etc.
However, this week we ran a &amp;ldquo;Git 101&amp;rdquo; workshop. Weirdly, this was the most attended workshop we have run, with around 50 engineers joining throughout the hour session.
This post covers what we ran through.

      <description>When forming a new team (or joining a team for that matter), I always try to get the following item in our code review standards, or ways of working.
Make sure all commits in version control are logically atomic.  What is a logically atomic commit A logically atomic commit is the smallest, most meaningful change you can make to the software. It&amp;rsquo;s big enough to add value, but small enough to be manageable.</description>
