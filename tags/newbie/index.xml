      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember what your Maths teacher used to say?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Show your working out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I bet they said more than that, but this is what I remembered. I think we used to get marked down if you just provided the answer. You got more marks when you showed how you derived your answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is a plea for software engineers to do the same when answering technical questions, or debugging an issue in group communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up a VS Code Dev Container - minikube</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post builds on what we already learnt in &lt;a href=&#34;https://benmatselby.dev/post/vscode-dev-containers/&#34;&gt;Setting up a VS Code Dev Container&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s more specific goal is to discuss running Dev Containers whilst using &lt;a href=&#34;https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/&#34;&gt;minikube&lt;/a&gt; as a Docker Desktop replacement on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is lots of chatter about the new license for Docker Desktop. The license changes impacts the business I work for. I wanted to know what our options were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting minikube as a drop in replacement for Docker Desktop on the Mac, was relatively straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week my team was tasked with picking up a project that I had last worked on 4 years ago. The deadline was tight, and we had a week to complete it. It was written in PHP, a language I&amp;rsquo;d barely written in the last 3 years. Obviously a lot has changed in 4 years (both in the language, setup, and the team I work in). I am the only engineer in my team now who knows PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
