      <description>This year has seen a transformation in terms of working practices. Whether things will ever go back to the way they were, I do not know, but there is one thing I hope will remain.
To sum up the last 3 years. I went from managing a team of engineers located in 2 geographic locations, to becoming a remote Individual Contributor in a co-located team. This year changed everything, and we all became engineers in a distributed team.</description>
