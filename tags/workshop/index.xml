      <description>Since the start of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running weekly workshops with Paddy Morgan at work. These have been fun sessions to run. Some have been chats, some demos etc.
However, this week we ran a &amp;ldquo;Git 101&amp;rdquo; workshop. Weirdly, this was the most attended workshop we have run, with around 50 engineers joining throughout the hour session.
This post covers what we ran through.
 Time allocation: 60 minutes</description>
