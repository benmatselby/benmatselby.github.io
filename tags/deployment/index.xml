      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just released version v1.2.1 of the Hugo Deploy to GitHub Pages GitHub Action.
This means it now fully conforms to the metadata specification as defined here.
I wrote this action back when GitHub Actions were still in beta, and there were very few actions out there. It turns out there are a plethora of GitHub Actions to now deploy a Hugo site to GitHub Pages, but where is the fun in using someone else&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

      <description>SugarCRM is a Customer Relationship Management system for both Enterprise and small business. Iâ€™ve worked on SugarCRM for around 6 years, and this post is going to cover off how we release/deploy the software on a 2 week cycle.
The Aim As with any software, the aim is to have an automated release process first and foremost. We wanted this process to be simple and allow for a completely automated release to our staging platform on a nightly basis.</description>
