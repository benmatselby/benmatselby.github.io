      <description>&lt;p&gt;My aim with this blog is to document how I like to run my teams, and note the various things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen during my career. When meeting new people, there is a tendency to cover old ground (I&amp;rsquo;m skilled at this), which is useful in the sense you have a common understanding, but it can be time consuming. A few times recently I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to provide substantial opinions, but the communication format doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself well to that style. With this in mind, I&amp;rsquo;m writing my thoughts down, so folks can read in an async manner, comfortable to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
