      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post aims to cover off a simple checklist 📝 to work through when joining a new engineering team 👩🏾‍💻👨‍💻. Whilst this is aimed at senior or technical lead positions, these tips can help everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently switched teams at work, and something dawned on me. Over the last 8 or so years I&amp;rsquo;ve generally built teams, and not really joined an existing team. So joining an existing team, with their own established ways of working, and existing decisions is something rather 👽 to me. This is also the first time, in the same period, where I am the only remote engineer on the team 😬.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
