      <description>Pipelines.
They are very important in software development, in my opinion. If you do not get your pipeline right, you likely have problems within your team(s).
So, what is a pipeline?
Well, think of it has a conveyor belt in a factory. The software development pipeline is a conveyor belt. From projects, to requirements, to building/testing, to deploying, and to everything in between. Those processes/items are moving along the conveyor, ideally in a smooth fashion.</description>
