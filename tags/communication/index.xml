      <description>In a previous post I talked about communication, and what it’s like as a remote engineer. I also hinted at the tooling I prefer, and outlined what I look for. This post is going to cover off why I prefer Slack for team chat/communication.
Spanning a 10 year period I’ve used: IRC, Google Wave, XMPP in various forms, Skype, GTalk and Google Hangouts, Slack, Microsoft Teams and Workplace. Slack is a clear winner for me, although at the time Google Wave blew me away.</description>

      <description>It’s cliched to say, but communication really is key, and yet it’s one of the common issues folks seem to raise in departmental or company feedback. “Communication isn’t great”. However, this is both a top down, and a bottom up issue in my opinion (and everything in between).
Top down like to send out update emails, but the flow of communication is one way. Do I reply, reply all, face to face?</description>
