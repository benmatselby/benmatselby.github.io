  <p>I took <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> for a spin this week, and this post covers what I noticed whilst using it as my day-to-day editor.</p>
<quote class="pullquote">
  I love it, and I'm probably going to stay with it (but I miss a debugger).
</quote>

<p>This is what Zed is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It&rsquo;s also open source.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="projects-worked-on">Projects worked on:</h2>
<p>These are the projects I managed to work on this week with Zed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python project - 4m+ lines of code</li>
<li>Go project - 7k+ lines of code</li>
<li>Markdown - This blog post</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="no-debugger">No debugger</h2>
<p>Honestly, I thought I would miss this a lot more than I did. However, to remove VS Code from my setup, I&rsquo;d need the debugger. Firing up a second editor, to find the files, to then debug is a little tedious.</p>
<h2 id="its-fast">It&rsquo;s fast</h2>
<p>Apart from searching for a symbol, which feels slower than VS Code, Zed seems quicker overall. I prefer the slim-down nature of it in comparison to VS Code. It certainly reminds me of Sublime Text, which I loved (and also now struggle to remember why I stopped using it!).</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-ui">Collaboration UI</h2>
<p>I managed to get a colleague to pair with me for 15 minutes using Zed, and it took us a wee while to get used to what the user interface was telling us. It&rsquo;s handy though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screensharing - Although we couldn&rsquo;t seem to configure which screen to share, so it shared my work diary, not the screen with the editor on. You live and learn.</li>
<li>Audio 1:1 calling - This was the first thing we tried, and the quality levels were very good.</li>
<li>Channel audio - It seems like you have to join the audio even if you just want to use the text chat. Maybe this was an oversight by us though?</li>
<li>Channel messaging - Slight <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/6706">bug</a> that you couldn&rsquo;t copy the messages from the chat window.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have one slight concern about this feature: Normally all this context is in Slack (for me at least), but it would be in Zed. Does this lose a collaboration touch point with the rest of the team who aren&rsquo;t in Zed? One to ponder. You may want to pull in a Product Manager, or a designer into the conversation (They are generally saviours to any given situation). I highly doubt they would install an editor to do that. It does, however, remind me of the early 2000&rsquo;s when engineers had to use IRC to communicate with each other. It&rsquo;s a little bit secret, which makes it fun.</p>
<h2 id="git-integration">Git integration</h2>
<p>This was a surprise to me, as I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated this impacting me. I use <code>git</code> on the CLI. I&rsquo;ve never used a UI, and I struggle with them for <code>git</code>. However, what I did miss was the little &ldquo;git insights&rdquo; you can get in VS Code. e.g. &ldquo;Developer Alice modified this code last week&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This gives you a sense of &ldquo;freshness&rdquo; of the code. Back to <code>git blame</code>.</p>
<h2 id="keymaps">Keymaps</h2>
<p>Although it says I was using the VS Code one, there were a <a href="https://github.com/benmatselby/dotfiles/blob/main/zed/keybindings.json">few keymap changes</a> I needed to make. No big drama.</p>
<h2 id="outline-view">Outline view</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have the Outline View as a scrollable dock item, rather than a modal. It feels prohibitive as a modal, and it doesn&rsquo;t allow you to collapse certain symbols. So in a codebase that may have 15 classes in a file, you couldn&rsquo;t focus on the class you want to look at. It&rsquo;s all expanded.</p>
<h2 id="unused-variables">Unused variables</h2>
<p>It would be good to highlight unused variables, assuming this comes from the language server. It wasn&rsquo;t a biggy, as pre-commit hooks captured it, but it slows you down ever so slightly.</p>
<h2 id="copilot">Copilot</h2>
<p>Easily configured, but I did miss having Copilot Chat. You can use the <a href="https://docs.zed.dev/general/assistant-panel">Open AI integration</a>, but I already have a license for GitHub Copilot, so not sure I want to pay for both services.</p>
<h2 id="it-seems-to-just-work-tm">It seems to &ldquo;Just work (tm)&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pretty much <a href="https://github.com/benmatselby/dotfiles/tree/main/vscode">automated the install for VS Code</a>, but it feels like there is a &ldquo;lot going on&rdquo;. That doesn&rsquo;t feel the same with Zed. I opened a Python file for the first time, and it downloaded the language server. Same with the Go codebase.</p>
<p>Apart from the debugger, it had the right level of tools I needed. I also work on TypeScript and PHP projects, so that will be the next test to see how it handles those languages.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick with it. I suspect I will fire VS Code up when I need to debug something, but let&rsquo;s see how we go with Zed for a little bit longer.</p>
